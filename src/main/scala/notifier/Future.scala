/** A cut-down version of the Futures from the Scala 2.10 standard library
  * (mostly), implementing the basics of both the Future and Promise sides
  * of the interface.
  *
  * A future represents the result of some asynchronous computation which
  * one thread is computing, which is of interest to at least one other.
  * Threads with an interest in the result can ask to be informed when it
  * is ready (via the onSuccess, onFailure, and onComplete methods), which
  * take a callback as an argument, and invoke it on the calling thread
  * when the result is available (possibly immediately).  For this to work,
  * the calling thread must be an Android `HandlerThread` (which includes
  * the threads that the framework itself invokes to run `Service`s and
  * `Activity` user interfaces).  If the result is already available, these
  * will complete immediately.
  *
  * The thread that is actually doing the work can call `succeed` or `fail`
  * to make a result available to other threads (or actor-like entities)
  * with an interest.
  *
  * The monadic future combinators from the Scala 2.10 and Akka libraries
  * are not yet available, but should probably show up in due course.
